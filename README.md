# Quick Note
I've had a few false starts with this assignment. Initially, I struggled with coming up with a strategy to tackle the project and twice I became so tangled in the JavaScript that I had to restart. 

Although frustrating, I did learn a lot from those first two attempts, and they have certainly informed my approach this go-around.

As you'll see, I have a lot of work to do, and plan to re-submit the assignment on Friday. I also have some time set up with a tutor for Friday to trouble-shoot any last concerns and hopefully make some final fine-tunings.

My next step will be to apply a loop for my array so that the question elements cycle through the game's container div sequentially with the corresponding answer options populating in the answer selection buttons. 

From there, I'll add boolean logic to highlight the correct and incorrect answer buttons for each respective question, followed by an if statement to add points to a score.

Last, I'll tack on a clock that starts when the quiz start button is clicked. I have yet to determine what function will trigger if the clock runs out.

Any feedback or advice you might have as I work toward submitting v2 on Friday would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks!
